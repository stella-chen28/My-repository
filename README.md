Here are the projects' summary and quick link, pick the ones you have interest in:

+ [Music Recommendation System](https://github.com/stella-chen28/My-repository/tree/master/Music%20Recommendation%20System)
    + Cleaned original 3,500,000 data and did Exploratory Data Analysis with visualization.
    + Did recommendation with the traditional memory-based algorithm, clustering algorithm, and Alternating Least Squares Method (ALS) algorithm. Improved the accuracy of recommendation from 1% to 32.3%.

+ [Predictive Modeling – Improve Images’ Resolution](https://github.com/stella-chen28/My-repository/tree/master/Predictive%20Modeling%20%E2%80%93%20Improve%20Images%E2%80%99%20Resolution)
    + Applied gradient boosting and convolutional neural network models in image super-resolution with patch-based image feature extraction.
    + Used 1,500 pairs pictures to do cross-validation, obtained the optimal model with PSNR 24.62 and 3s/pic.

+ [R Shiny: College Recommendation System](https://github.com/stella-chen28/My-repository/tree/master/R%20Shiny-College%20Recommendation%20System)
    + Collected, cleaned and integrated over 2GB data.
    + Built web pages with UI design and data visualization, such as map, radar chart, boxplot and line plot.
    
+ [Optical character recognition (OCR) with R](https://github.com/stella-chen28/My-repository/tree/master/Optical%20character%20recognition%20(OCR)%20with%20R)
    + Applied Letter Positional Binary Digram algorithm to do error detection on the OCR output text.
    + Extracted six feature scores and regressed the labels on them with Adaboost model to make error correction. Improved the word-wise precision by 10%.
    
+ [Text Mining on HappyDB with R](https://github.com/stella-chen28/My-repository/tree/master/Text%20Mining%20on%20HappyDB%20with%20R)
    + Cleaned and tidied the corpus of 100,000 crowd-sourced happy moments.
    + Did data visualization on network analysis and word usage compare using ggplot2, wordcloud2, ggiraph, shiny.
    + Did Topic Modeling on the corpus from different groups of people and wrote a blog post using R Notebook.
    
+ [Portfolio Construction for Different Communities](https://github.com/stella-chen28/My-repository/tree/master/Portfolio%20Construction%20for%20Different%20Communities)
    + Selected stocks out of S&P500 with high Sharpe Ratio. Did asset allocation by Mean-Variance analysis and Risk Parity method with R.
    + Combined with the risk-free asset (Treasury Bill) to construct optimal portfolio for different clients.
    + Used empirical distribution, t-distribution and GARCH model to do risk management, computed VaR.
