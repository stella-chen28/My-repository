Caveats:
"1. Note that maximum heat index data are sparse. Heat index data are recorded only for days when the air temperature is above 80"
"degrees Fahrenheit (26 degrees Celsius). When heat index data is not available in results table due to sparseness of data then"
"it will be labeled ""Missing"". More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/nldas.html#Heat Index."
